# Fide et Astra

**Fide et Astra** is a Christian initiative committed to promoting space colonization as a moral and spiritual responsibility.

We believe that expanding humanity beyond Earth is not just a scientific goal, but a divine calling.

Our mission is to inspire a faith-informed approach to settling the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

We aim to connect theology, ethics, and space science in a unified vision.

Through advocacy, education, and outreach, we prepare the Church for an interplanetary future.

✝️ Faith does not hold us back — it propels us forward.
